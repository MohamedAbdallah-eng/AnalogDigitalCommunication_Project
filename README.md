# AnalogDigitalCommunication_Project
Part(1): Implementing a matlab function that takes an arbitrary number of signals as an input (M signals) and uses gram schmidt procedure to produce the minimum number of required orthonormal bases function (N bases function) to represent the M signals.
Part(2): Using the constellation diagram generated in part1 for calculating the bit error 
rate of binary data that are line coded using binary polar NRZ
